                    It is one of the six negative signs, and its ruling planet

                    Léōn, Latin for "lion") is the fifth sign of the zodiac. It
                    corresponds to the constellation Leo and comes after Cancer
                    and before Virgo. The traditional Western zodiac associates
                    Leo with the period between about July 23 and August 22,
                    and the sign spans the 120th to 150th degree of celestial
                    longitude.

                    Leo is associated with fire, accompanied by Aries and
                    Sagittarius, and its modality is fixed. The constellation
                    Leo is associated with the mythological Nemean lion.[3] The

                    romanized: Parthénos) (Latin for "virgin" or "maiden") is
                    the sixth astrological sign in the zodiac. It spans the
                    150–180th degree of the zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac,
                    the Sun transits this area (on average) between August 23
                    and September 22.[2] Depending on the system of astrology,
                    individuals born during these dates may be called Virgos or
                    Virgoans.[3]

                    The sign is associated with Astraea. In Greek mythology,
                    Astraea was the last immortal to abandon Earth at the end of
                    the Silver Age, when the gods fled to Olympus – hence the
                    sign's association with Earth.[4] She became the
                    constellation of Virgo.[5] Virgo is one of the three Earth
                    signs, along with Capricorn and Taurus.[6] </p>

                    astrological sign in the zodiac. It spans 180°–210°
                    celestial longitude.[2] The Sun transits this sign on
                    average between September 23 and October 23.[3][4] The
                    symbol of the scales is based on the Scales of Justice held
                    by Themis, the Greek personification of divine law and
                    custom.[5] She became the inspiration for modern depictions
                    of Lady Justice. The ruling planet of Libra is Venus along
                    with Taurus.[6][7] Libra is the only zodiac sign that is
                    represented by an object; with the other eleven signs
                    represented by either an animal or mythological character.</p>

                    War, in archery.
